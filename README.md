## 🛠️ Overview

IMDA (Intelligent Maintenance Decision Agent) is an **AI-driven tool** designed to assist in predictive maintenance by analyzing industrial telemetry data (temperature, pressure, vibration, etc.). It uses a **PyTorch model** to predict faults, **SHAP** for interpretability, and **LLM-powered repair suggestions** via Hugging Face and LangChain. Data and context can be optionally stored in a **Chroma vector database**.

🖼️ A sleek **Gradio UI** allows users to interact with the tool, visualize results, and provide feedback.
